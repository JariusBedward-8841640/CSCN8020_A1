##  Project Members:
    1. Jarius Bedward #8841640

## Project Summary:

This project goes through 4 problems in relation to Reinforcement Learning covering topics like pseudocode, MDP and Monte Carlo. States, Actions, Rewards, Policies were all defined and analyzed.



## Requirements:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt

##  🎯  How to Run:

1. Clone this repo (git clone <repo-url> cd <repo-folder)
2. Install Required Dependencies: "pip install -r requirements.txt"
3. Open the jupyter notebook
4. Run all the cells within the notebook


## Extra Notes:

I wrote talking points and markdown for the cells answering questions from the pdf and I also answered things on the pdf so to get the full picture you may have to go back and forth. For problems 1 and 2 they are purley done on the pdf but problems 3 and 4 are split between the pdf and jupyter note book with most of the things being done on the notebook with some extra insights on the pdf
